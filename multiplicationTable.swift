/*
  You're responsible for printing a grid displaying a multiplication table.
  The single argument on the command line will specify the size of the grid.
  For example, if the program is invoked as:, ./multiplicationTable 3 
  Your output should be:
       1   2   3
  1    1   2   3
  2    2   4   6
  3    3   6   9

  You may assume that the maximum grid size is 20.

  Be sure that the numbers in your grid are aligned (i.e. columns are flush right)
  For example:
      3
      6
      9
     12

  Include an assert statement for each assumption that you are making.
