/*
  You're responsible for dispensing money from an ATM.  
  The ATM can only dispense $5 and $20 bills.
  
  The command line will specify the total dollar value to withdraw which must be 
  divisible by 5.
  You must print one line indicating that either a $5 or $20 bill was dispensed
  for each bill dispensed.

  For example, if the program is invoked as:  ./complexATM 75
  Your output should be:
  $20.00 dispensed
  $20.00 dispensed
  $20.00 dispensed
  $5.00 dispensed
  $5.00 dispensed
  $5.00 dispensed

  Include an assert statement for each assumption that you are making.
